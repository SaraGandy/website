abstract: In many of the small island communities of the Caribbean, much of the vector surveillance effort is focused on house-to-house peri-focal surveys to collect data on larval indices. Adult mosquito trapping is not always routine or affordable and is usually focused on ad hoc biting issues or small-scale investigations. This makes understanding the relative importance and densities of the common urban mosquitoes, such as *Aedes* *aegypti* and *Culex* *quinquefasciatus*, problematic. This snap-shot survey in February 2022 using BG-Sentinel traps at 30 different locations across five islands of the Turks and Caicos, aimed to provide the first island-wide assessment of urban mosquito densities. In total, 2,820 adult mosquitoes were collected over 285 trap nights. *Aedes* *aegypti* was most common on the island of Providenciales, with very low densities recorded on South Caicos, North and Middle Caicos, with *Ae*. *aegypti* most highly abundant in the main commercial centres. The highest densities of *Cx*. *quinquefasciatus* were trapped on North Caicos. Small numbers of other species were also collected, including the first record of *Anopheles* in TCI. This established framework of trapping and initial assessment provides a platform for continued monitoring of mosquitoes in TCI to better inform mosquito-borne disease risk assessment and future vector control efforts.
