abstract: Human granulocytic anaplasmosis and tick-borne fever, affecting livestock, are diseases caused by an infection with the bacterium *Anaplasma* *phagocytophilum*. Its transmission dynamics between vertebrate hosts and ticks remain largely unknown and the potential impact on public health in the United Kingdom is unclear. This study aimed to assess the distribution and estimate the prevalence of *A*. *phagocytophilum* in questing *Ixodes* *ricinus* at recreational locations across England and Wales over six years. An additional objective was to investigate possible associations between prevalence, habitat and presence of ruminant hosts. *Ixodes* *ricinus* ticks were collected each spring at twenty recreational locations across England and Wales for five years. Nymphs were tested for infection with *A*. *phagocytophilum* by detection of bacterial genome in DNA extracts, targeting the msp2 gene locus. Positive samples were further investigated for the presence of different ecotypes based on the GroEL region. Northern England had a higher overall prevalence compared to Southern England and the presence of sheep was associated with higher *A*. *phagocytophilum* prevalence. There was also a negative correlation with the prevalence of *Borrelia* *burgdorferi* s.l. (causing Lyme borreliosis). When investigating the diversity of *A*. *phagocytophilum*, ecotype I accounted for the majority of samples. Our study presents an overview of *A*. *phagocytophilum* prevalence in questing *I*. *ricinus* in recreational areas across England and Wales and discusses the potential public and veterinary health relevance.
