abstract: Following the expansion of the invasive mosquito *Aedes* *albopictus* (Diptera, Culicidae) through Spain along the Mediterranean coast, mosquito surveillance was established in Gibraltar in 2016. This paper reports on the first detection of *Ae*. *albopictus* in Gibraltar in 2017 as well as subsequent efforts to monitor the establishment of the species, including longitudinal data over several years since 2018, and results of a snapshot survey in 2021 on adult mosquito density. *Aedes* *albopictus* has become established across most of Gibraltar, with defined seasonality from August to October, slightly later than the peak in *Culex* *pipiens* densities. The larval habitats for Ae. albopictus remain largely enigmatic. Mosquito samples tested for chikungunya and West Nile virus were all found to be negative, and this paper includes recommendations for future control efforts and infectious disease risk assessment.
