abstract: Assessing the risk of tick-borne disease in areas with high visitor numbers is important from a public health perspective. Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, *Borrelia* prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. *Ixodes* *ricinus* were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established *I.* *ricinus* populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs  and infected nymphs were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with *Borrelia* were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia were only reported from Richmond Park, where *Borrelia* *burgdorferi* sensu stricto and *Borrelia* *afzelii* were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised.
