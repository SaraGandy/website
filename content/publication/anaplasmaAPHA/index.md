abstract: The pathogen *Anaplasma* *phagocytophilum* is the aetiological agent of tick-borne fever in cattle and sheep, and granulocytic anaplasmosis in human and dogs. Livestock, companion animal and human infections with *A*. *phagocytophilum* have been reported globally. Across England and Wales, two isolates (called ecotypes) have been reported in ticks. This study examined *A*. *phagocytophilum* isolates present in livestock and wildlife in Great Britain (GB), with a particular focus on cattle. Clinical submissions (EDTA blood) from cattle (n = 21) and sheep (n = 3) were received by APHA for tick-borne disease testing and the animals were confirmed to be infected with *A*. *phagocytophilum* using a PCR targeting the Msp2 gene. Further submissions from roe deer (n = 2), red deer (n = 2) and *Ixodes* *ricinus* ticks (n = 22) were also shown to be infected with *A*. *phagocytophilum*. Subsequent analysis using a nested PCR targeting the groEL gene and sequencing confirmed the presence of ecotype I in cattle, sheep, red deer and *I*. *ricinus*, and ecotype II in roe deer and *I*. *ricinus* removed from deer carcasses. Despite the presence of two ecotypes, widely distributed in ticks from England and Wales, only ecotype I was detected in cattle in this study.
