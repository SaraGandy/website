summary: I presented a poster on the presence of Ixodes ricinus and its associated pathogens/endosymbionts on the Isle of Wight at the British Ecological Society conference in December 2023
abstract: 'Tick-borne disease incidence is predicted to increase over the next decade so itâ€™s important to understand drivers of tick density and pathogen prevalence. Deer are important reproduction hosts for ticks and are known to drive their abundance. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate tick density and pathogen prevalence in an island where deer are absent. Questing nymphs (n=155) were collected in 2018 and 2021 at 26 sites on the Isle of Wight and were tested for a range of pathogens and endosymbionts. Questing nymph density was significantly higher in sites were livestock grazed, indicating that cattle and sheep could drive tick abundance in the absence of deer. *Anaplasma phagocytophilum* was detected in 40.6% of questing nymphs, *Babesia divergens* & *Rickettsia helvetica* in 1.3% and *Borrelia valaisiana* & *Borrelia miyamotoi* in 0.6% of questing nymphs. *Rickettsiella* (65.8%), *Midichloria* (63.9%) and *Spiroplasma ixodetis* (1.3%) were also detected.
