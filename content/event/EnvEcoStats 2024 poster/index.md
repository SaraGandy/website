summary: I presented a poster on the ecosystem processes driving Lyme disease hazard in urban greenspaces at the EnvEcoStats conference in July 2025
abstract: 'Urban greenspaces can provide ecosystem services (heat mitigation, recreation) but also disservices, including tick-borne disease hazard. Most studies investigating ecological drivers of tick-borne disease hazard focus on woodlands, as they are known to have high hazard however, rural ecosystem processes are likely to be different to those in urban areas. In this study, we aimed to understand mechanisms driving deer space-use, tick density and Lyme disease hazard in urban areas. We surveyed urban greenspaces and surrounding hinterland sites across 12 towns in England and Scotland and used Structural Equation Modelling to investigate how connectivity, tree cover, built-up cover and recentness of urbanisation affected deer space-use, tick density and Lyme disease hazard.
