summary: I presented on the ecological drivers of *Ixodes ricinus* ticks in urban greenspaces in the UK at the UKVD conference in December 2024
abstract: 'Within- and between-city contexts and interactions shape our experiences of city life. However, a gap in understanding is how the wider landscape context of cities and interactions with hinterlands influence urban ecology and health hazards. Using a meta-ecosystem framework, we fill this gap for the tick-borne Lyme disease ecological system by comparing tick and Lyme disease hazards of urban and hinterland sites for 16 UK cities. We discover that the hazards of ticks and Lyme disease of urban greenspaces are two- and three-fold lower than of hinterland woodlands. Crucially, urban tick and Lyme disease hazards are shaped by tick abundance and land cover of hinterlands, but not of cities themselves. This highlights how rural-urban interactions form meta-ecosystems and urban eco-epidemiology and public health risk can depend more on the surrounding landscape than within-city landcover. We therefore need to consider interacting factors outside cities to better understand the drivers of urban ecological processes and mitigate disease risk.'
