summary: I presented a poster on the impacts of host community composition on Lyme disease hazard at the Ecology & Evolution of Infectious Diseases conference in May 2018
abstract: 'Transmission cycles of vector borne diseases often rely on competent host species maintaining the pathogen as well as reproduction hosts maintaining vector populations. This is the case for Lyme disease (LD), caused by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l and transmitted by ticks. However, how the relative proportions of competent and non-competent hosts in a community affect LD risk is still unclear. To test this, we collected data on host abundance (deer, rodents) and tick population from 20 sites in North East Scotland. Consistent with our expectation, prevalence of Borrelia afzelii (genospecies associated with rodents), was positively correlated with rodent abundance. However, prevalence was negatively correlated with deer density and decreased to 0% at high deer density (32ind/km2), regardless of rodent abundance. These results show how abundance of non-competent hosts can modulate transmission risk and are consistent with deer acting as dilution hosts at high densities in this system. '
