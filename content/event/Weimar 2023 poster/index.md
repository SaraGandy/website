summary: I presented a poster on the National Tick Survey at the 15th International Symposium on Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases in March 2023
abstract: 'Understanding the variation in pathogens infections rates in *Ixodes ricinus ticks* is important for assessing potential transmission of tick-borne diseases. The aim if this study was to conduct a snapshot survey at recreational areas in England and Wales to understand infection prevalence for three tick borne transmitted pathogens. *Ixodes ricinus* nymphs were collected each spring at 20 recreational areas across England and Wales between 2014 and 2019. Questing nymphs were individually tested for presence of three pathogens; *Borrelia burgdorferi* s.l. (causing Lyme disease), *Anaplasma phagocytophilum* (causing anaplasmosis) and *Babesia* spp (causing babesiosis). Regarding *B. burgdorferi* s.l., 4104 nymphs were individually tested. Site-specific *B. burgdorferi* s.l. infection rates in *I. ricinus* nymphs varied from 0% to 9.7% depending on locations, with an average infection rate of 4.0%. Genospecies composition of sequenced samples was 62.5% *B. garinii*, 0.3% *B. valaisiana* and 17.2% *B. afzelii*. *Anaplasma phagocytophilum* was detected in 3.6% of questing nymphs (n=3919 tested), ranging from 0% to 20% depending on the location. Ecotype I accounted for 87% of positive samples and ecotype II for 13%. *Babesia* spp. was detected in 0.4% of ticks (n=3931). Ranging from 0% to 2.0%. Northern England and Wales had higher infection rates for *A. phagocytophilum* (4.7% and 12.1%) whilst *B. burgdorferi* s.l. infection rates were higher in southern (5.4%) and northern (2.3%) England. *Borrelia burgdorferi* s.l. infection rates were higher in woodland (5.6%) compared to grassland (2.6%) whilst more ticks were infected with *A. phagocytophilum* in grassland (6.7%) compared to woodland (0.6%). Infection rates for the three studied pathogens varied depending on geographical locations and this study increases the knowledge on the prevalence of causing agents of tick-borne diseases infection in recreational areas across England and Wales.'
